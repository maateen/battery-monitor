## User Manual

### Auto Start
Every time Battery Monitor starts automatically after PC boots up. It pops up notifications and you see its **Icon** in the system tray. To reveal the other beauties, you can click on the icon. Currently, there are three menus: Settings, About and Quit.

You can also start battery monitor from the menu entries. Please, search for Battery Monitor launcher in the menu entries and simply click on it. In case, if Battery Monitor doesn't start automatically, please open an issue. We would like to debug the issue and help you.

### Settings
In Settings menu, you can configure and adjust settings for Battery Monitor.

#### Configuration
Here, you can set the battery percentage levels at which you want to get notifications. The warning levels are listed in ascending order. **Critical Battery Warning** refers to the lowest level while **First Custom Warning** refers to the highest level. Custom warning levels are optional.

If you change any configuration, it will be in action only after next reboot.
